# MoonSpire

The Giant Moth has taken over the tower, and it's up to you to deliver the eviction notice! Fight your way through this vertical puzzle platformer to the top to reach the unlawful moth and remove it from the tower to restore peace in the minds of the royal family! But be careful not to fall or get hit by the monsters or you'll fall and have to climb up again.

## Personal Note
This is my second full game (see [Heavens Ablaze](http://sumrbrandr.github.io) and its [source code](https://github.com/SumRbrandR/HeavensAblaze)). I learned a lot from HA. Thanks to it Moonstruck Tower is much better organized and has cleaner code. 

This game is available on [my itch.io page](https://treadthedawngames.itch.io/).

The purpose of project was to learn the Godot engine in preparation for the GMTK Game Jam 2024. My team member had only used GameMaker up until we decided to do the jam, and I'd only used Unity. I'd tried GameMaker, but I didn't like the workflow. We decided on Godot for the engine because we both had interest in learning it, and that way neither one of us would be overwealmed learning a new engine. We'd both be :).
